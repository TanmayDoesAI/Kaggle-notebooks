# Kaggle-notebooks

- This repository contains Kaggle notebooks I have worked on for various Kaggle competitions.

- I try to provide comments explaining my approach in the notebooks. However, please note that the exploratory data analysis (EDA) might not be included in these notebooks as it is usually an iterative task.
